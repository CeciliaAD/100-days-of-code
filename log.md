# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 11, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: Started The Complete Developer Course, worked on HTML.

**Thoughts:** Right now, covers the same things I've already learned, but I want to follow the course so I'm doing everything again.


###Day 2: January 12, 2019 (Saturday)

**Today's Progress: Finished HTML5 part of the Complete Web developer course I've started. I have to make a web page with HTML5, probably I will also prepare the portfolio web for FCC and obtain the first certificate of Resposive web design (even I fell I don't know nothing yet).
