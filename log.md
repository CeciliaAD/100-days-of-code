**Today's Progress: Finished HTML5 part of the Complete Web developer course I've started. I have to make a web page with HTML5, probably I will also prepare the portfolio web for FCC and obtain the first certificate of Resposive web design (even I fell I don't know nothing yet). 



### Day 3: January 13, 2019

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow I will have more time, I hope to finish them and move on.


### Day 4: January 14, 2019

**Thoughts:** I fell I can't make the pages look good. I need to learn more.

### Day 5: January 15, 2019 


**Today's Progress**: All day with CSS, Codeacademy again. I've checked some online test that I passed.

**Thoughts:** Seams I'm learning.
